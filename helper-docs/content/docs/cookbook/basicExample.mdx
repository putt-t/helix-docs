A basic example of how to use HelixDB

We’re going to create a simple social network where users can follow each other and create posts.

### Step 1: Define the schema in schema.hx      
We’re going to define the schema for our social network in `schema.hx`. 
We’re going to have `User` nodes where users can `Follow` other users. 
We’re also going to have `Post` nodes where users can `Create` posts.

```
N::User {
    name: String,
    age: U32,
    email: String,
    created_at: I32,
    updated_at: I32,
}

N::Post {
    content: String,
    created_at: I32,
    updated_at: I32,
}

E::Follows {
    From: User,
    To: User,
    Properties: {
        since: I32,
    }
}

E::Created {
    From: User,
    To: Post,
    Properties: {
        created_at: I32,
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Inserting data
Creating a user is done by inserting a new node into the graph.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Helix</th>
<th>Python</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
  
```
QUERY CreateUser(name: String, age: U32, email: String, now: I32) =>
    user <- AddN<User>({name, age, email, created_at: now, updated_at: now})
    RETURN user
```
  
</td>
<td>

```
{
    "name": "mary",
    "age": 25,
    "email": "mary@example.com",
    "created_at": 1722528000,
    "updated_at": 1722528000
}
```

</td>
</tr>

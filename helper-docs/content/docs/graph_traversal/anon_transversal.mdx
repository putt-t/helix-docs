title: Anonymous Traversals
description: Anonymous traversals are used as inner traversals that don’t break the overall traversal flow. They continue as a ‘sub-traversal’ starting from the previous step.

### Anonymous Transversal

```text tab="Helix"
_::<traversal>
```

**Example:**

```text tab="Helix"
QUERY filter_users() =>
    users <- N<User>::WHERE(_::In<Follows>::COUNT::GT(1))::Out<Follows>
    RETURN users
```

```py tab="Python"
class filter_users(Query):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
    
    def query(self) -> List[Payload]:
        return [{}]
    
    def response(self, response):
        return response

#### Example ####
db.query(filter_users())
```

This query will filter the users by the number of followers they have without breaking the overall traversal flow.

To clarify, this means that the `_::` starts a new traversal that start from the elements returned by the previous step.
